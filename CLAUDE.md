# CLAUDE.md

Context for AI-assisted development on `lazy-cherry-pick`. Read this first when entering the repo.

## In one paragraph

A Tauri 2 desktop app for batch Git cherry-pick workflows. Rust backend spawns a Go sidecar and talks to it over **newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin/stdout**. The sidecar shells directly to `git` CLI (no library). Frontend is Svelte 5 + TypeScript via SvelteKit. M5 mostly done: commit detail panels, dry-run conflict preview, 2-panel side-by-side diff viewer (TortoiseGit-style with EOL markers + trailing-newline transform), conflict resolver UI (3-way merge editor), staged diff for resolved files, Create Branch button, and all M4 features (progress bar, Cancel, Fetch/Pull, recent repos).

|---|---|
| `app/src/routes/+page.svelte` | Main orchestrator — 3-pane UI, all app state |

## Commands

Fresh PowerShell sessions on Windows often lack cargo/go on PATH. Always prepend:
```powershell
$env:Path = "$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin;C:\Program Files\Go\bin;" + $env:Path
```

**Rebuild sidecar** (required after editing any `sidecar/*.go`):
```powershell
$triple = (rustc -vV | Select-String "host:").ToString().Split(":")[1].Trim()
Set-Location sidecar
go build -o ..\app\src-tauri\binaries\sidecar-$triple.exe .
```

**Run Go integration tests:**
```powershell
Set-Location sidecar
go test ./internal/git/ -v
```

**Sidecar smoke test** (no Tauri — verify Go layer in isolation):
```powershell
$s = ".\app\src-tauri\binaries\sidecar-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe"
'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"ping"}' | & $s
'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"git.status","params":{"repo":"C:\\path\\to\\repo"}}' | & $s
```

**Rust compile check** (no Vite needed):
```powershell
Set-Location app\src-tauri
cargo build
```

**Dev server (full app)** — must be run in the user's own terminal (see hard rule #1):
```powershell
.\dev.ps1
# or: cd app && npm run tauri dev
```

## Hard rules for AI agents

1. **Never run `npm run tauri dev` via a background/agent task.** Gets terminated when parent shell exits. Always ask the user to run it in their own terminal. (Verified during M1.)

2. **After editing `sidecar/*.go`, rebuild the binary to `app/src-tauri/binaries/sidecar-<triple>.exe`.** Tauri bundles the binary at dev time — source changes are invisible until rebuild. On this machine the triple is `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.

3. **When adding RPC methods:** (a) implement in `sidecar/internal/git/`, (b) register in `sidecar/main.go` via `s.Register("name", wrap1(...))` — except methods that need progress streaming, which use a manual handler (see `git.cherryPick` pattern), (c) update `docs/IPC.md`, (d) add TypeScript types to `rpc-types.ts`, (e) add typed wrapper to `rpc.ts`. No Rust change needed per method.

4. **JSON over stdio is NDJSON** — one JSON object per line. Never embed raw `\n` inside a JSON value. Go's `json.Encoder.Encode` always appends `\n` — keep using it.

5. **Strip UTF-8 BOM on every input line.** `rpc/server.go` does `bytes.TrimPrefix(line, utf8BOM)`. Don't remove — Windows PowerShell pipes prepend BOM.

6. **Target branch model is Model B with default = current HEAD.** Sidecar always checks dirty tree before applying. If `target != current`, checkout happens only after dirty-tree check passes. Implemented and tested in `cherrypick.go`.

7. **The sidecar is the only layer that shells out to `git`.** No `git` calls in Rust, no direct `git_*` invocations from Svelte. Path: Frontend → `rpc.ts` → `invoke('sidecar_call')` → Rust `sidecar_call` → Go sidecar → `git`.

8. **The frontend has no `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell` dependency.** Svelte uses `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog` (for folder picker) and our own `sidecar_call` command only. Never add `plugin-shell` to Svelte — it would expose shell APIs to the WebView.

## Architecture invariants

- **One sidecar process per RPC call (current model).** `sidecar_call` does `spawn → write 1 line → read N lines → kill`. Progress-streaming calls (`git.cherryPick`) emit multiple `progress` lines before the final `result` line. Rust reads in a loop, emits Tauri event `cp-progress` for each progress line, then resolves on the final line. ~30–50 ms overhead per call.
- **Concurrent sidecar calls are safe.** `ActiveSidecar` is `Mutex<HashMap<u64, CommandChild>>` with a per-call atomic `call_id`. Each call stores its child by `call_id` and removes only its own entry on finish — concurrent calls from multiple windows (e.g. main + conflict editor) cannot kill each other's processes. `sidecar_cancel` drains the entire map.
- **Progress protocol:** intermediate lines carry `"progress"` field (not `"result"/"error"`) with the same `id`. Rust detects by `parsed.get("progress").is_some()`. Frontend listens via `@tauri-apps/api/event` `listen("cp-progress", ...)`.
- **Cancel:** `sidecar_cancel` Tauri command drains `ActiveSidecar` (`Mutex<HashMap<u64, CommandChild>>`), killing all active children. Frontend then calls `git.abort` via a new sidecar spawn to run `git cherry-pick --abort`.
- **Recent repos:** stored in `%APPDATA%/lazy-cherry-pick/recents.json` by Rust commands `recents_load`/`recents_save`. Max 10 entries. Not routed through the Go sidecar.
- **Sidecar logs to stderr, responses to stdout.** Don't write logs to stdout.
- **Capabilities are scoped to `binaries/sidecar`.** Don't broaden to `shell:default`.
- **Write operations require explicit user action.** `git.cherryPick` is only triggered by the Apply button — never called automatically. Read methods (`git.status`, `git.commits`, `git.fetch`) are fine to call on load/branch-change.

## What's done / what's not

**M1 done**: project scaffold, IPC contract validated end-to-end (`ping`, `version`).

**M2 done**: full Go git ops layer — `git.openRepo`, `git.status`, `git.branches`, `git.commits`, `git.cherryPick`. 9 integration tests (all pass). TypeScript typed wrapper (`rpc.ts`, `rpc-types.ts`).

**M3 done**: main UI — Toolbar (file dialog open), CommitList (source branch + multi-select), PickQueue (ordered queue + target dropdown + Apply), ResultBanner (applied/conflict/error). Happy path fully wired end-to-end.

**M3.1 done**: Apply & Push — TortoiseGit-style dropdown on Apply button. `git.push` RPC method. Mode state persists between operations.

**M4 done**:
- **Progress streaming**: `git.cherryPick` emits progress lines (`{"progress": {"n":1,"total":3,"sha":"..."}}`) before final result. Rust reads in loop + emits Tauri event `cp-progress`. `PickQueue` shows progress bar `n/total — sha`.
- **Cancel**: `sidecar_cancel` Tauri command kills current sidecar child. Frontend calls `git.abort` to cleanup git state. Cancel button visible during apply.
- **Recent repos (M4b)**: Rust `recents_load`/`recents_save` commands write `%APPDATA%/lazy-cherry-pick/recents.json`. Toolbar shows "Recent ▾" dropdown (max 10 entries).
- **Fetch / Pull refresh**: `git.fetch` (`git fetch --prune`) and `git.pull` (`git fetch <remote> <branch>:<branch>`, fast-forward only). CommitList header has Fetch/Pull dropdown button.

**M5 mostly done**:
- **M5a — Commit detail panels**: click commit → resizable panel below shows CommitDetail (subject, body, SHA, author, date, parents) + CommitFiles (file list with status badge, +/- stats, click to open diff window). Horizontal resize handle between CommitList and PickQueue panes.
- **M5b — Dry-run conflict preview**: `git.dryRunPick` RPC uses `git apply --3way --check`; ⚠ icon on queue items with predicted conflicts; debounce 400 ms.
- **File diff viewer**: `git.fileDiff` RPC (`git show --unified=99999`); opens in a new Tauri window (`diff-${Date.now()}`); nav buttons ▲/▼ to jump between change blocks. Now **2-panel side-by-side (M5d)** — see below.
- **Create Branch**: `git.createBranch` RPC; Create Branch button in PickQueue target dropdown.
- **M5c — Conflict resolver (done)**: `git.conflictFiles`, `git.resolveConflict`, `git.continueCherry`, `git.fileContent`, `git.writeAndStageFile` RPCs; `ConflictResolver.svelte` with Keep Ours/Use Theirs/Continue/Abort; `/conflict` route — TortoiseGit-style 3-pane merge editor:
  - **Line numbers** in each top pane (independent theirs/ours counters)
  - **Inline conflict-header bar** per block: "Conflict N/M · ← Theirs · T+O" (left) / "Ours → · O+T" (right) — action buttons right at the conflict, no need to use toolbar
  - **Independent drag-select per pane**: `leftSel` + `rightSel` state — selecting on one pane does NOT clear the other; right-click shows cross-pane combine options when both have selections
  - **Context menu**: use selected lines from this pane / use whole block / combine both sides (4 order combinations)
  - **Resizable H-divider**: drag to resize top/bottom ratio (20–80%)
  - **Keyboard**: ↑↓ to navigate conflicts
  - **Provisional resolution model**: clicking Theirs/Ours/T+O sets a *soft choice* in `provisionalChoices: Map<number, string[]>` — `mergedText` keeps conflict markers intact. Bottom pane shows chosen lines in **orange** immediately, but user can click any button again to change. `buildFinalText()` applies all choices only at save time.
  - **Bottom pane (TortoiseGit style)**: provisionally-resolved blocks shown in orange with change buttons (← Theirs / Ours → / T+O) always visible; unresolved blocks shown as **hatched red placeholder** with Ours/Theirs/T+O buttons; click block → jumps top panes to that conflict
  - **Toggle "✎ Raw"**: enables inline contenteditable on `.mv-text` spans (visual mode + direct edit). Yellow highlight on edited lines. Exit syncs DOM back only if `rawEdited` was set (avoids overwriting state when user just looked at raw mode).
  - **Save status**: button "Lưu & Stage" disabled when `hasUnresolved || applying || saved`; after save shows "✓ Đã lưu" badge instead of auto-closing window.
  - Flow: cherry-pick stops in conflict state → ConflictResolver shown → click file → conflict window opens → resolve each block (changeable) → Lưu & Stage → click Continue → `continueCherry` applies the staged commit + remaining queue commits via `applyPickShas()`.

- **M5d — Polish & diff viewer redesign (done)**:
  - **Project rename**: `cherry-pick-git` → `Lazy Cherry Pick`. Tauri productName/identifier updated; AppData path is now `lazy-cherry-pick/recents.json`; Go module is `github.com/lazy-cherry-pick/sidecar`.
  - **Staged diff for resolved files**: `git.stagedFileDiff` RPC (`git diff --cached --unified=99999 -- <file>`); ConflictResolver opens this in a diff window (gray button) when a file is already resolved, instead of the merge editor.
  - **2-panel side-by-side diff viewer (TortoiseGit-style)**: complete rewrite of `FileDiff.svelte`. Layout: left/right panels with independent labels (`Before`/`{sha}` for commit diff, `HEAD`/`Staged` for staged diff), synced scroll, hatched filler rows when one side has no matching line, hunk header spans both panels.
  - **EOL markers (Notepad++ style)**: toggle `¶` button shows `LF` (blue) / `CRLF` (orange) at end of each line. Parser auto-detects trailing `\r` and handles `\ No newline at end of file` as `eol="none"` (no marker rendered).
  - **Trailing-newline transform (Option D + lookahead)**: when a paired `change` row has `leftText === rightText` but EOL differs ("none" vs "lf"/"crlf"), convert to `ctx` row + phantom empty `change` row (representing the implicit empty line that appears/disappears with the trailing newline). Lookahead skips the phantom if the next row is already an empty del/add — prevents double-counting when the diff covers both an empty line AND the trailing newline. Matches TortoiseGit's "editor view" rather than git's "lost trailing newline" view. See `design-side-by-side-diff` memory.
  - **Raw-mode save fix in conflict editor**: setting `rawEdited = false` after successful save prevents the "blank screen" bug when toggling back to visual mode.

**Not done**: smart filter UI, settings, packaging, signing.

## Cross-session memory

When working with the user on this repo, prior decisions are stored as Claude memories:
- `user-language-vi` — communicate in Vietnamese, prefer short option-style questions
- `project-m4-complete`, `project-m5-complete`, `project-m5c-wip`, `project-m5d-complete` — feature checklists per milestone
- `design-conflict-merge-logic` — conflict merge editor (provisional model, parser, render pipeline)
- `design-side-by-side-diff` — 2-panel diff viewer logic incl. trailing-newline transform with lookahead

These memories complement (not replace) this file. This file describes the **codebase**; memories describe the **user and decisions**.

## When stuck

- Sidecar weirdness → run it manually with a piped JSON request to isolate from Tauri (rule #5 may apply if first response is a parse error).
- Rust compile errors after editing `lib.rs` → check plugin version in `Cargo.toml` and the plugin docs.
- Tauri window blank → check the Vite log in the terminal where `tauri dev` runs before assuming Rust is broken.
- "Method not found" with correct method name → did you rebuild the sidecar binary? Rule #2.
- Frontend type error after adding a new RPC method → add types to `rpc-types.ts` and wrapper to `rpc.ts` first.
